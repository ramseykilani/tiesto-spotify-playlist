# tiesto-spotify-playlist

A program to get the latest tracklist of Tiesto's Clublife, and create a spotify playlist from it.

If you want to do it for older episodes, open the index page, scroll down a lot, download that version, and skip automatically downloading the index page. Or else, this will work for the latest few episodes.

Add a config.ini like below with your spotify id and secret

[spotify]
client_id = 
client_secret =
